Initially limited by the need to use complex cooling systems and efficient power supply systems, today - already in miniature versions - it is used in many distant fields. Thermal imaging devices are indispensable for quick target detection, and with the development of technology, their miniaturization takes place, while maintaining the appropriate matrix resolution, sensitivity and power demand.",
        "thermovisionText-a-bold": "We believe that the work currently underway to combine with night vision and digital technology will allow us to offer even better solutions in the near future.",

        "thermovisionText-b": "Usually, a simple assessment of its declared technical parameters is not enough for the proper selection of a device. Often devices made of the same matrices (by different manufacturers) give a completely different optical impression. The quality of the image obtained results not only from the simple parameters and quality of the components used, which can be checked in the DTR (lens, matrix, display), but also from non-obvious factors, such as the software used.",

        "nightvisionText-b": "Initially large, uncomfortable (e.g. backpack) and requiring a large amount of electricity (strong light bulbs with IR filters), the devices have evolved to achieve a compact (350 gram) size, with a working time of over 40 hours on one battery. ",
        "nightvisionText-b-bold": "Technical progress in night vision technology is enormous and concerns not only the light amplifiers themselves, but also their power electronics, available bright optics, light construction materials as well as ergonomics and precision of workmanship.",

        "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "faq-1": "What is manual gain control and what is it for?",
        "faq-1a": "What are the types of phosphorus?",
        "faq-2": "Is green or white phosphorus better?",
        "faq-3": "Are 4G transducers Generation 2?",
        "faq-4": "Do you export night vision devices abroad?",
        "faq-5": "Do I need a permit for night vision?",
        "faq-6": "What are the basic parameters of the night vision device?",
        "answer-1": "As standard, the converters are equipped with a power supply with automatic gain control. The electronic system selects the brightness of the generated image optimally to the current conditions. Optionally, for selected models of equipment, transducers with automatic and manual gain control are available. With this function, you can manually reduce the brightness of the image to suit your preferences. Setting the manual gain control to the brightest position will cause the converter to automatically adjust the brightness.",
        "answer-1a-a": "White phosphorus - transducers equipped with a white phosphor screen generate an image close to black and white, with a delicate blue glow. This image is more natural to the human eye and provides greater contrast.",
        "answer-1a-b": "Green phosphorus - drivers with a green phosphor screen produce a black and green image. The human eye can distinguish the most shades of intermediate green so that more detail is visible.",
        "answer-2": "There is no clear answer to this question, a lot depends on the individual preferences of the user. White phosphorus has recently been gaining popularity mainly due to the generation of a more natural image for humans - black and white. It provides a more contrasting image and allows for easier, simultaneously advantageous, night vision and thermal imaging devices. It should be remembered that green phosphorus reflects more colors, thanks to which it is easier to identify observable objects and in the case of Photonis transducers, it provides about 10-20% better amplification of the transducer.",
        "answer-3": "There are two aspects to consider to answer this question. First, in the world, the main division is made on the basis of the American standard established by the U.S. Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate. It separates generations based on key components, not the parameters achieved. Generation 2 includes all transducers equipped with a multi-channel plate (MCP), while generation 3 includes a device with an MCP plate and a GaAs photocathode. As 4G transducers are equipped with the latest multi-material photocathode capable of wide-spectral operation, and not GaAs photocathode, they do not formally meet the definition of generation 3. However, it should be emphasized that the performance of these transducers is equal to generation 3 and in some cases they outclass it. The only field where Generation 3 achieves better parameters are the conditions of extreme darkness, but this advantage is not big. Importantly, the Photonis 4G transducers introduced in 2014 are the first in the world that meet the assumptions for 4G night vision, that is:",
        "answer-3-list": {
            "a-point-1": "- Extended work spectrum - ",
            "a-point-1a": "transducers collect and amplify photons for a wide spectrum of wavelengths, delivering high-quality images in all conditions and environments (from <400nm to> 900nm)",
            "a-point-2": "- High FOM - ",
            "a-point-2a": "FOM value above 1800 (for military transducers).",
            "a-point-3": "- High resolution - ",
            "a-point-3a": "resolution always above 57 lp / mm, even in the most light polluted conditions such as urban areas or buildings where the light is suddenly turned on.",
            "a-point-4": "- Little halo"
        },
        "answer-4": "Both new and used civil night vision equipment can be shipped to any person or company in the European Union. It should be remembered that in the case of transporting your own equipment abroad (e.g. going hunting), you should first make sure that the possession of such equipment in the destination country is legal and that the appropriate official permission for export has been obtained. In addition, export without additional costs is possible to the countries listed in the general EU export authorization, i.e. to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, Norway and Japan. If you want to purchase equipment with shipment abroad, please contact us in advance.",
        "answer-5": "Night vision equipment can be divided into two categories - civilian and military equipment. Civil equipment is treated as dual-use goods and can be freely purchased by citizens of the European Union and the countries listed in point 4. A separate category is equipment manufactured specifically for the needs of the army or the police, which is treated as items of strategic importance, which, both as new and used, may be purchased only by authorized bodies.",
        "answer-6a": "Resolution - expressed in pairs of lines per millimeter (lp / mm). This is the limiting resolution that a night vision transducer provides when measured in the central area. As a rule, the higher the resolution, the easier it is to see details of objects in the field of view.",
        "answer-6b": "Photocathode Sensitivity - This is a measure of the ability of the tube to convert the residual light into an electrical signal. The more photons are converted into electrons, the better the MCP is able to amplify the signal for a brighter and more distinct image.",
        "answer-6c": "FOM (Figure of Merit) - general indicator of the converter quality, calculated by the product of the resolution sensed in lp / mm and the signal-to-noise ratio. FOM = lp / mm * SNR",
        "answer-6d": "HALO - this value determines the amount of the glow surrounding bright points in the night vision image.",
        "answer-6e": "FOV - defines the field of view, expressed in degrees. This value corresponds to the viewing angle of the device.",
        "answer-6f": "Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR, S / N) - This value is a measure of the amount of light reaching the observer's eye measured in relation to the noise generated by the image intensifier. The higher the SNR value, the lower the amount of noise in the image, which is very important when using the devices, especially in residual lighting conditions. Gain @ 2.10-5 lx",
        "answer-6g": "Resolution in the middle is the same as resolution",
        "answer-6h": "Resolution> @ 200 lux - same as resolution only under bright lighting conditions.",
        "answer-6i": "EBI - this is the amount of light that is generated by the transducer when there is no photocathode illumination. The EBI level determines the lowest illumination level at which an object can be observed on the transducer screen."
